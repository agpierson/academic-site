# Abstract.
abstract = "This paper presents the first results of a comparative study effected to determine whether the French written medical language of professionals presents a distinct distribution of causal expressions. First, I discuss the theoretical background and research questions that underpin our project. Then, I describe the two corpora – the medical corpus and the reference corpus – that I have analysed. After that, I detail our methodology, introducing the typology I have constructed and the tools used for this study. Afterwards, I undertake the evaluation of our typology and the analysis of the syntactic observations that I have made thus far. Finally, I summarize the current findings of our research and suggest some avenues for future research that our study opens up."
