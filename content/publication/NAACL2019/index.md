# Abstract.
abstract = "This paper details the development of a new linguistic resource designed to integrate aspectual values in temporal information extraction systems. After a brief review of the linguistic notion of aspect and how it got a place in the NLP field, we present our clinical data and describe the five-step approach adopted in this study. Then, we describe our French linguistic resource and explain how we elaborated it and which properties were selected for the creation of the tables. Finally, we evaluate the coverage of our resource and we present several prospects and improvements to foresee."
